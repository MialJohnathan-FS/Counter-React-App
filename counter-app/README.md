This React application demonstrates the creation and implementation of a basic counter component. The Counter component displays a continuously incrementing number, updated every second. It provides a simple and interactive example of how to build dynamic components in React using state management and lifecycle methods.

## Key Features:

* Automatic Increment: The counter value is automatically updated every second, simulating a real-time counter.
* Clear and Concise Code: The component's code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for learning React concepts.
* Reusable Component: The Counter component can be easily integrated into other React applications, providing a versatile building block for various use cases.

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand the concept of state in React and how to use it to manage component data.
* Learn how to use the useEffect hook to perform side effects, such as updating the counter value.
* Explore the basics of component rendering and updating in React.
