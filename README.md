# Counter-React-App
This repository will be for recording my practical knowledge learned when building a application using React. 

# Overview:
## ‚öôÔ∏è Building a Foundational Understanding of React with Reusable Components ‚öôÔ∏è

This repository serves as a practical learning space for me to solidify my understanding of React's core principles by creating reusable components. Inspired by the "Master React in 5 Days: Become a React Expert in Under a Week" book by Eric Sarrion, I'm actively working through the concepts and applying them to construct modular components that can be seamlessly integrated into larger React projects.

### Key Objectives üèÅ:
* Gain hands-on experience with React's building blocks by crafting simple, reusable components.
* Enhance my understanding of fundamental React concepts such as JSX, components, props, and state management.
* Strengthen my proficiency in Distributed Version Control (DVC) practices using Git for efficient code versioning and collaboration.
* Showcase my ability to leverage JavaScript frameworks like React to build dynamic user interfaces.

### Target Audience üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë:
* Self-directed Learners: This project is primarily intended for my own learning journey, allowing me to solidify my React knowledge through practical application.
* Potential Employers: This repository also serves as a showcase for my technical skills and passion for learning. The reusable components within demonstrate my ability to work with React and its core concepts.

### Technoligies Used üíª:
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Git: A distributed version control system for managing code changes.

# Getting Started:

For those interested in exploring the code and following my learning process, feel free to clone this repository.

## Future Plans:

I intend to progressively build more complex and reusable components, enhancing my React expertise.
I may explore integrating these components into a larger React application to demonstrate their functionality in a practical context.
Please note that this project is under active development.
